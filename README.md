this repo will be my journey through SFML, the 2.6.2 version since I can't find guides on how to
use the 3.X
The PDF guide is the sfml official one, you can find it in the official website or in the
"assets" directory in this repo.
I'll go topic by topic, any new subect will have its own class and I'll try to comment as much as
i can: this has the intention to be a SFML Handbook to use whenever i need help with GUI's.
